# Platform-specific terminals (safe no-ops on other OSes):
simple-term-menu>=1.2.1; platform_system != 'Windows'
pick>=2; platform_system == 'Windows'
windows-curses>=2.2.0; platform_system == 'Windows'

# Optional extras your sources referenced:
requests>=2.31.0
# If you actually import PIL directly elsewhere, Pillow already covers it.

# Notes:
# - Keep this file for runtime. For CI releases, you can freeze exact versions with:
#     pip freeze > requirements-lock.txt
# - This aligns with streamrip's pyproject and your GUI imports, and avoids the
#   tidal-dl-ng/ttkbootstrap conflicts you saw (those packages are not required).
